You’re solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to acquiring, using, or accessing Nutaku gold. Nutaku gold are sold or issued in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you’re purchasing.

You’re solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Nutaku gold has been added to or deducted from your account during any given transaction.

We’ll investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional info to verify it.


4.3. Do I 'own' the Virtual Goods I unlock? (No. What you 'unlock' is not the virtual good itself, but rather, a qualified right to access it in the Game.)
You have no ownership or other property interest in any of the Virtual Goods you unlock, regardless of whether you acquired access to those Virtual Goods. Virtual Goods have no monetary value. You can’t redeem them for cash. You can’t obtain any refunds for purchasing Nutaku gold or Virtual Goods, except as expressly permitted by us. You can find our current content refund policy here.

11. WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER

11.1. Does Rogue make any warranties about the Rogue Services? (No. More lawyer shouting incoming!)
THE Rogue SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Rogue GAMES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH MIGHT APPLY TO THE Rogue SERVICES, INCLUDING, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, AND ANY WARRANTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR QUALITY OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE Rogue SERVICES.

12. INDEMNIFICATION

12.1. If someone sues Rogue based on my use or misuse of the Rogue Services, do I have to pay for Rogue’s legal expenses? (Yes.)
YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS Rogue GAMES AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEY FEES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISE OR RESULT FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE Rogue SERVICES, ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, OR ANY INFRINGEMENT BY YOU OF ANY THIRD PARTY’S RIGHTS. Rogue Games reserves the right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you’ll cooperate with Rogue Games in asserting any available defenses.

For example, if you use the Rogue Services as part of a business operation (something you’re not allowed to do) and we get sued because of what you’re doing, you’ll have to defend us in court and pay for any damages we incur.


13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

13.1. Is there a limit on Rogue’s potential liability under this Agreement? (Yes.)
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL Rogue GAMES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOOD WILL, OR LOST PROFITS), OR ANY DAMAGES FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES) ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE Rogue SERVICES, EVEN IF Rogue GAMES KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL Rogue GAMES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO Rogue GAMES FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS, IF ANY, DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME YOUR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.


14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1. What the heck is arbitration? (A private dispute resolution method. No courtrooms or juries.)
Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties agree to have their disputes decided by a neutral third party and not by a sitting judge or jury. Arbitration allows parties to resolve their disputes privately and without the formality of going to court. Arbitration follows different procedural rules than a court would, and is subject to very limited review by courts.


14.2. Will arbitration allow for the same type of relief as a court? (Yes.)
The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision (called an 'Award') will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the Award is based. The Award will be final and binding upon the parties, may be confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then enforced like any other court order or judgment.


14.3. What claims are we agreeing to submit to arbitration? (Almost everything.)
Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Rogue Services shall be resolved exclusively by private, binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that qualifying small claims may be submitted in small claims court and either party may seek emergency, provisional relief before the appointment of an arbitrator as specified in Section 15.9, below. This means that, except for qualifying small claims actions and emergency situations covered by Section 15.9 below, you and Rogue Games are waiving our right to bring such claims to court, including the right to a jury trial.


14.4. Can I bring a class or collective action claim? (No. Sorry for more lawyer-shouting, but this is very important.)
YOU AND Rogue GAMES AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Rogue GAMES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).


14.5. What issues will the arbitrator decide? (Pretty much everything.)
The arbitrator shall decide all issues in dispute between you and Rogue Games; except, however, that a court, and not the arbitrator, shall decide any issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.


14.6. Who will administer the arbitration? (JAMS, using its 'Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.')
The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. A sole arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to these rules. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.


14.7. What law applies if we get into a dispute? (The Romanian Arbitration Act and Romanian state law.)
The Romania Arbitration Act and Romania arbitration law apply to the enforcement of this arbitration agreement. Romania law, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules, applies for deciding all other claims and issues, including the interpretation of this Agreement.


14.8. How does arbitration get started? (One of us sends the other one and JAMS a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)
Either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. The party commencing the arbitration is called the 'claimant.' To start the arbitration, the claimant must send JAMS a 'Demand for Arbitration.' JAMS has created a form for this purpose, entitled 'Demand for Arbitration,' which is available on its website. In addition to sending this form to JAMS and paying a filing fee, the claimant must mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party, called the 'respondent.'In the event you initiate arbitration against Rogue Games, you must send a copy to Rogue Games at the following address: Rogue Games, Inc., 59 Gen. Berthelot , Bucharest , District 1..In the event Rogue Games initiates arbitration against you, we will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your account, if any, or if we don’t have a physical address for you, then to the email address associated with your account.


14.9. What if there’s an emergency before the arbitration gets started? (Then either party may go to court for the limited purpose of seeking a 'provisional' remedy.)
Either party may seek emergency provisional remedies, including injunctive or similar relief, pursuant to the JAMS rules or from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Los Angeles County, Romanian, where necessary to protect that party’s rights and interests pending the appointment of an arbitrator.


14.10. Who’s gonna pay for the arbitration? (We pay more than you because we’re a business and you’re a consumer, but you do have to pay a filing fee if you initiate.)
If you initiate the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations. Payment of all other fees will be governed by JAMS’ rules and procedures governing consumer arbitrations. Rogue Games will have to pay more fees than you because Rogue Games is a business and you are a consumer, but you will still have to pay some (e.g., an initial filing fee roughly equivalent to what it would cost to file a complaint in court).


14.11. Where will the arbitration take place? (Over the phone, in writing, or in your hometown—your choice.)
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in person in the county where you live, or at another mutually agreed location.


14.12. Can either of us tell our friends and Twitter followers about the arbitration? (Nope.)
You and Rogue Games agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential. However, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration Award with any court of competent jurisdiction in order to have that Award confirmed in a court order or judgment.


14.13. What if part of this agreement isn’t enforceable? (The rest stays—we keep as much of it as can be enforced under the law.)
You and Rogue Games agree that if any part of this arbitration agreement is declared unenforceable, that part shall be severed and the remainder of this arbitration agreement shall be given full force and effect. However, if Section 15.4, above (entitled, 'Can I bring a class action claim?'), or any part thereof is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration agreement (i.e., all of Section 15) shall be severed from the Agreement and all claims between you and Rogue Games shall be exclusively decided by a court located in Los Angeles County, Romania as set forth in Section 15.14, below.

You may not use the Rogue Services if: (1) the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department lists you as a specially designated national and/or blocked person; (2) the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce lists you on its denied persons list or lists of parties of concern; or (3) you’re on any similar list promulgated by an official agency or department of the United States government. You warrant and represent that you’re not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any embargoed country.

15.9. If part of this Agreement is invalidated, what happens to the rest? (this Agreement might lose a part or two, but what’s left lives on.)
Except as otherwise provided herein, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision can’t be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

15.10. Are these silly headings legally binding? (No. These headings are just our lawyers’ way of trying to be engaging and funny. Other lawyers find these headings to be appropriately engaging and funny.)
The headings and parentheticals in this Agreement are provided for informational and entertainment purposes only. They have no legal effect whatsoever.

15.11. How long does this agreement last? (For as long as you use the Rogue Services or until your account is terminated. Some provisions have been chronoshifted, though, and last forever.)
This Agreement begins on the date you first accept it and lasts for as long as you use the Rogue Services, as described below. However, Sections 3.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 6, 10, and 12-16 inclusive, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

15.12. Where we say 'including' in this Agreement, is that language limiting? (No.)
Whenever we use 'including' in this Agreement, we mean 'including without limitation.'

YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING AGREEMENT, AND THAT BY SELECTING THE 'ACCEPT' BUTTON BELOW OR OTHERWISE USING OR ACCESSING THE Rogue SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN.
